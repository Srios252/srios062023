- 4 categories of macromolecules: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Lipids, and Nucleic Acids.
- Acids are found in DNA and RNA.
- Amino Acids are linked together by peptide bonds.
- Lipids are made of glycerol and fatty acids.
- Carbohydrates are found in sugars and starch.
- Monomers are repeating subunits.
- Polymers are long chains of monomers.
- Lipids are hydrophobic.
